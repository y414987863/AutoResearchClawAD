"""Multi-model debate engine (Stage 8 / 14 / 18).

Upgrades the project's shallow "multi-perspective one-shot" pattern into a real
debate:

  1. multiple *models* each play a distinct role (round-robin over the panel),
  2. an optional rebuttal round where every role sees the others' prior turn and
     pushes back, and
  3. an independent judge that scores and ranks the perspectives; the final text
     is then synthesized either by that judge (legacy) or, when a distinct
     ``synthesizer`` is given, by the stronger model anchored to the ranking.

Opt-in: callers only route here when ``build_panel_llms(config)`` returns a
non-empty panel (i.e. ``llm.debate_enabled`` is set). When the panel has a single
model this degrades to single-model multi-role, matching the legacy behaviour
plus a judging step.

The engine is provider-agnostic and offline-testable: it only calls
``client.chat(messages, *, system=...)`` on whatever clients it is handed.

            Empty list is not allowed — callers must pass at least one client.
        judge: independent judge client (scores/ranks the perspectives). Falls
            back to ``panel[0]`` if None.
        synthesizer: client that writes the final synthesis. When None (or the
            same object as the judge) the judge does scoring AND synthesis in one
            call (legacy). When a distinct client is given, scoring and synthesis
            are split: the independent ``judge`` scores/ranks (anti
            self-preference) and the (stronger) ``synthesizer`` writes the final
            text, anchored to that ranking — keeps the judge independent while
            letting the strong model produce concrete, falsifiable output.
        roles: ``{role_name: {"system": ..., "user": ...}}`` (domain bank).
        variables: template variables for ``_render``.
        rounds: number of rebuttal rounds after the opening statements.
        synth_prompt: name of the judge/synthesis sub-prompt (e.g.
            ``"hypothesis_synthesize"``).
        out_dir: directory for per-role / per-round transcripts + record.
        prompts: PromptManager (for ``sub_prompt`` rendering).
        author_model: generator model name, for provenance.

    Returns:
        ``(final_text, record_dict)``. ``final_text`` is the synthesis produced
        by the ``synthesizer`` (or the judge, in the legacy single-call path);
        ``record_dict`` is also written to ``out_dir/debate_record.json``.
